<h3>March 24, 2016 Guess Who's Back? Here is an update of where I'm at with my project: I have committed to creating a Wordpress. During class this evening I set up my account and selected 3 themes that seemingly meet my user experience desires. This week I want to play around with each theme and get a better insider understanding of which theme will work best for my project. I think I will need some support doing some general navigation of wordpress based on the 20 minutes I just spent tooling around.</h3>

<h4>April 7, 2016
Journal time. I've successfully chosen my WP theme (Spun!) and have tooled around on it a bunch such that I know how to do the things that I know I want to do at this point. One change from my original project idea is to expand the scope of the portfolio concept from focusing on one specific student project to showcasing one project/piece of work from each class I teach. Then at the of the year, every class I teach will have something to share and many other projects to explore. I feel my biggest task now is to continue the documentation of the ongoing work in my classrooms. I'm also considering reaching out to some professional photographer friends, because my crappy iphone photos look a little lame on the sleek WP theme. 

Question for the teaching team: The "Spun" theme is a series of circluar photographs that turn from BnW to color when you mouse over the circle. Could we build in some code to also play audio when you mouse over each circle? Please and thank you!</h4>

<h5> Will this work? </h5>
